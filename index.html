	notes:
	there should be an html attribute assigned to specify unit name/type.

	TODO:

	- UPDATE enemyAI.js 
	- attach enemyAI functions to button via eventListener, not in line 
	- create separate modules for each unique card 
	- bundle modules to import as one? webpack?
	- make all components React components?
	- add a reporter at the bottom of the page - i.e. a console that records all the actions during the game

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27290013/how-to-render-multiple-children-without-jsx
	
	
	thought of something:
	it would make sense for cards to be deativated (and cleared from the screen) after use, but how to do that?
	for example, if I'm supposed to place a unit, as soon as I click activate the card (and its description) could disappear, 
	but what if I was still reading the card? also, can I cancel? 
	
	if we want to clear the card after placing the unit, I have to somehow set a current state like 'activatedCard' and 
	listen for some change on the grid (i.e. placing a unit). then I can clear the card. 
	
	to show some effects when dealing damage:
	this looks cool https://opengameart.org/content/hit-animation-2-frame-by-frame

	for testing:
	https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/01/08/pros-cons-e2e-testing-tools.html
	
	convert Game to a React component? 
	when card is activated, should we have a message passed as a prop from the card to the hand to the game?
	card activated -> send msg to hand -> hand sends msg to Game -> Game rerenders console with new msg
